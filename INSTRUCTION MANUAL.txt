Sonic The Hedgehog Kyukyoku Instruction Manual

------------Story--------------
Sonic and Shadow were, once again, going head to head. While racing through Chaotic Mound, they noticed Infinite, being a goddamn edgelord and screaming to nobody about how he's not weak or something.
Sonic looked to Shadow and said "Why is Infinite still here?"
And so their journey began.
Little did they know, Metal Sonic was right behind them.
Mighty hopped down from his perch up on a cliff and followed the three.
